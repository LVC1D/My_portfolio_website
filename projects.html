                    <p>Using basinc HTML and CSS knoweldge, I have built a simple yet modern-looking 
                        business website that showcases various "projects" for various industries in the tech industry.

                    <p>Using JavaScript, this piece of code generates 
                        some funny and weird phrases based on picking a 
                        random element from a given array, 
                        and concatenates them together.</p>

                    <h3>Bank Account Simulator</h3>
                    <p>
                        Using basic Swift functionality, we created a much-simplified bank account simulator by using structs and classes, as well as functions 
                        as the main drivers of the business logic.
                        Here, we can check the balance of our account, as well as make deposits, withdrawals and even exit the bank account simulation.

                    <p>
                        Using basic and more advanced Swift functionlaity, I have built a basic restaurant app where one can book a table, browse through the menu and place orders for delivery.
